# Python Crash Course

## If you are not the original owner

Please feel free to look around. I am trying to develop my programming skills, so I can't promise you'll find anything good. 

My comments in code leave something to be desired, so feel free to mock me for it. Hopefully then I will fix it.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to work through the exercises presented in *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes. For the first part of the book, the exercises will be broken apart by chapter, with each chapter having its own folder. This is subject to change, pending on reusing pieces of code.
